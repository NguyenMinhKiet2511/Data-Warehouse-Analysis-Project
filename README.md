# Data-Warehouse&Analysis-Project
Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw operational data and ending with business-ready insights. The goal is to show not only technical SQL skills, but also analytical thinking, data modeling, and the ability to prepare reliable data for decision-making.

The project simulates a real-world enterprise environment by integrating CRM and ERP data, building a structured data warehouse, and performing data analytics on curated datasets.

Data Warehouse Design
Architecture

The data warehouse is designed using the Medallion Architecture:

Bronze Layer: Stores raw CRM and ERP data with minimal transformation.

Silver Layer: Cleans, standardizes, and integrates data to improve quality and consistency.

Gold Layer: Provides analytics-ready datasets optimized for reporting and analysis.

Data Analytics & Insight Generation

Using the curated Gold-layer data, this project focuses on understanding business performance through SQL-based analysis.
Key Activities

Built a SQL Server–based data warehouse to transform raw operational data into structured analytical tables.

Developed ETL pipelines to ingest, clean, and integrate tens of thousands of rows from CRM and ERP sources.

Applied data quality checks (completeness, consistency, validity) to ensure reliable downstream analysis.

Modeled the Gold layer using fact and dimension tables (star schema) to support scalable analytics and reporting.

Analytical Focus Areas

Customer Analysis: customer behavior, segmentation, and value contribution.

Product Analysis: product performance, revenue concentration, and lifecycle insights.

Time-Based Analysis: trends, growth patterns, seasonality, and performance changes over time.

Key Outcomes

Transformed raw CRM and ERP data into analytics-ready datasets.

Built a scalable foundation for reporting and further BI development.

Generated actionable insights related to revenue drivers, high-value customer segments, and top-performing products.
